=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you attach this role, your L<Moose> class gets an additional attribute
C<http> which contains a L<Reflexive::Client::HTTP>. This allows you to add a
simple C<on_http_response> method, which gets the
L<Reflexive::Client::HTTP::ResponseEvent> on the success of a previous
executed call to L</http_request>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 http

This watched attribute containts the L<Reflexive::Client::HTTP>. It handles
L</http_request> which triggers L<Reflexive::Client::HTTP/request>.

=head2 http_options

This HashRef is used for constructing the L<Reflexive::Client::HTTP> in
L</http>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 http_request

See L<Reflexive::Client::HTTP/request>.
